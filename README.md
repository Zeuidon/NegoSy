# Introduction
In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, negotiation is crucial for transactions, spanning from major deals to everyday purchases. However, integrating negotiation into online platforms faces reasoning hurdles. 
Many e-commerce sites struggle to offer effective negotiation mechanisms tailored to individual preferences and budgets.

This lack of a robust negotiation framework leads to missed opportunities for both customers and businesses. Customers may struggle to secure the best prices, while businesses may lose sales due to inflexible pricing. 

# Problem Statement
* An innovative solution is needed, leveraging AI and Natural Language Processing. A Price Negotiator E-commerce Chatbot can address these challenges, enhancing customer satisfaction, streamlining transactions, and boosting revenue for online retailers.
* E-haggling is the process of negotiating prices online, through an online negotiation platform. This platform allows buyers to make an offer on a product, and the seller can instantly counteroffer through an automated system until they reach a mutually agreed upon price. Automation of the platform eliminates the wait for the counteroffer and shrinks the haggling process down to only seconds or minutes.

# Proposed Methodology
1. Query Acquisition from User
Users will select the product of interest, encounter doubts, or find the price beyond their budget.
Users will opt to negotiate and seek clarification through the e-commerce site's AI chatbot.
Users will interact with the chatbot, inputting queries without requiring assistance from customer executives.

2. Dialogue Roll-out
Chatbots will autonomously address customer queries, minimizing the need for human intervention.
Dialogue roll-out will involve planning long-term conversations between users and the chatbot, fostering a seamless interaction.

3. Sentiment Analyzer
The sentiment analyzer will identify the user's queries by analyzing the sentiment, word repetition, and task aims within the sentences.
Queries will be broken down into parts, allowing the chatbot to understand the user's intentions and provide solutions independently.
Tag-words will be selected from the analyzed words to further refine the understanding of user queries.

4. Large Language Model (LLM)
LLm will be employed to present solutions based on the sentiment analysis and understanding of user queries.
The chatbot will utilize LLM to process the input data and provide responses tailored to the user's needs.
By leveraging LLM, the chatbot shall autonomously generate responses, enhancing the user experience without involving business executives.
